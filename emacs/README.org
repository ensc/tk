* What is "tk.el"?

"tk.el" is an emacs script which sends information about idle status
and active buffers to the tk daemon.

* Usage

Add something like

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(when (file-exists-p (concat (getenv "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR") "/tk.sock"))
  (load-file (concat (getenv "HOME") "/src/tk/emacs/tk.el"))
  (ensc/tk-start))
#+END_SRC

to your =.emacs=. Adapt socket path and location of =tk.el= as needed.
