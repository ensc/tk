* What is "tk-daemon"

"tk-daemon" listens for messages from supported clients and writes the
content of these messages into a database.

** supported events

 - connect :: sent be all clients when connecting to "tk-daemon"

 - focus/unfocus :: sent by window manager when window gets focus or
   when focus is removed.

 - manage/unmanage :: sent by window manager when window is created or
   closed

 - name :: sent by window manager when window changes its name; this
   happens e.g. when shell is configured to write the current working
   directory into the xterm title

 - idle/resume :: sent by clients which support the concept of an
   "idle" state.  For window manager this is e.g. triggered when the
   values returned by =XScreenSaverQueryInfo()= exceed a configurable
   threshold, or for emacs when its idle timer reaches a limit

 - buffer enter/leave :: sent by editors when a buffer (emacs terminolgy;
   corresponds usually (but not always) to a file) is entered
