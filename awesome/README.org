* What is "tk.lua"

"tk.lua" is an awesome plugin to send information about window related
events to tk-daemon.

* Usage

Put something like

#+BEGIN_SRC lua
tk_mod  = require("/home/ensc/src/tk/awesome/tk")
local tk = tk_mod.init()

tk.rules = {
    { class = "Firefox", name = ".*%(Privater Modus%).*" },
    { class = "Keepassx" },
    { class = "Kioexec" },
    { class = "Emacs", name = "^ %*Minibuf%-1%* - .*", is_new = false },
}

tk.connect_signals(tk, client)
#+END_SRC

into =$HOME/.config/rc.lua=.

Adapt path names as needed and add selectors matching windows which
you want to be ignored from recording.
